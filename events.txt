    below The alchemists complain, a little, but then continue with their experiments.
    belowEffect alchemists - 1
    argument Who knows what substances the alchemists work with? Pouring them into the lake is clearly unsafe.
    argument The lake is the source of much of our prosperity. We must protect it.

option Allow the alchemists to dump their substances.
    above The alchemists are emboldened in their experiments. Soon, the fish from the lake acquire a decidedly bitter aftertaste.
    aboveEffect alchemists + 1 fishermen - 2
    below The alchemists continue their experiments. The fish keep tasting the same, pretty much.
    belowEffect alchemists + 1
    argument The head of the alchemists' guild insists that the substances they work with are pretty harmless, and completely so when diluted into the lake.
    argument The fishermen are simply passing the blame for less-than-fresh fish on to the alchemists.

story Dyes
intro The alchemists have developed an artificial red dye, which they claim is cheaper and more beautiful than the dye traditionally traded by the city's merchants. The merchants insist that this new dye is of inferior quality and will ruin their business.
threshold alchemists 3

option Let the alchemists sell their new dye.
    above While the merchants lose some sales, the alchemists earn plenty of fame and money from the trade in this new dye.
    aboveEffect alchemists + 3 merchants - 1
    below The new dye, though beautiful, washes off easily and causes itching. The alchemists, humiliated, return to their experiments and fumes. The merchants' reputation suffers.
    belowEffect alchemists - 3 merchants - 2
    argument This represents an exciting new opportunity for trade in the city, but the merchants only think of short-term gains.
    argument Let the alchemists sell their wares, and the merchants theirs.

option Forbid this new dye.
    above The merchants rejoice as this challenge to their position is removed. The alchemists, banned from selling the dye, continue using it for their own clothes.
    aboveEffect alchemists - 1
    below The alchemists complain surprisingly little about the ban. It may have something to do with the way the dye fails to adhere to cloth for any length of time.
    belowEffect alchemists - 2
    argument The merchants have rather more experience in the practical use of dyes than the alchemists do. If they say it's bad, we should listen to them.
    argument I for one would not want to wear cloth that has been submerged in an alchemist's concoction. I doubt this dye is as good as they claim.

story Experiments by the sea
intro The Alchemists want to conduct experiments with a newly devised concoction which can supposedly turn the scales of fish into stainless steel. Steel is in very low supply in the surrounding area, so this could benefit the economy. The fishermen however are worried this will make the fish inedible.
threshold alchemists 4

option Allow alchemists to conduct experiments.
    above The experiments are successfull and the alchemists devised a new process for turning fish into steel. The economy thirves thanks to this new cheap source of steel, but most fish became inedible in the process and the fishermen are struggling.

threshold merchants 4

option Force merchants to sell available products to anyone.
    above The merchants are furious but ultimately powerless and are forced to sell the testicles to the alchemists. The aphrodisiac proves to be very effective and becomes a big seller, diminishing the profits of the merchants. As a result, the merchants stop stocking horse testicles completely, forcing the alchemists to stop their aphrodisiac endeavor.
    aboveEffect merchants - 2
    below The merchants are forced to sell the testicles to the alchemists. Due to the low quality of the horse testicles however, word spreads that the aphrodisiac is ineffective and the alchemists reputation sinks while the merchants stay unaffected.
